#What is CSV?

-CSV stands for <comma separated values>
-CSV files are a popular format for storing data
-Other ways to store data would be

  storage options =  ['databases' => largeAmountOfData
                      ,'spread-sheets'=> small Amount of databases
                    ];

-CSV's are simple, convenient, no drivers or special APIS to work with them

-Python has a csv module that makes working with csv's even simpler

-A csv is a text file that contains data

-often times the first row in a csv file is a header
    -- letting us know what the values represent - the remaining rows contain the data

-in each row the values are separated by commas

-because this is a text file there are no data-types
  -- all data are represented as strings
    --- so we must work with them as if they are strings

-When we read a csv it becomes our responsibility to convert/assign data-types to the data

#What does double coma's represent?

  -Double commas represent an empty field..
    -- this simply means that we are missing data for that field(s)

# how do we read and write csv's
  - will be shown within the main file
